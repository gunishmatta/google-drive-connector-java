OSlash â€“ Integration Engineering Assignment (Java)

```
Use the Google API to connect, fetch all documents currently existing, and then listen for changes on a particular Google Drive folder using WebHook.
Writes into a json file every 'n' batch size

```

**Instructions to Run this project:**

```

 - Open this in an IDE preferably Intellij
 - Add Spring Boot Run Configuration with
   com.gunish.oslashassignment.OslashAssignmentApplication as main Class
   and Run, the project will run on port 8080
 - Another important thing required is to port forward 8080 port using
   ngrok as we are using web hook to receive notifications and for that
   we have to create a Channel whose address requires a https url. So
   update that url in GoogleDriveServiceImpl for now,
   channel.setAddress("https://1c09-103-21-185-12.in.ngrok.io/notifications");

```
